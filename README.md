# Data Mining Techniques 2025
Repository for the first assignment of Data Mining Techniques, made by group 23: Mikko Brandon, Marinde van Dijk, Juliëtte Dop.  
All relevant code can be found in DMT_Marinde_Mikko.ipynb and DMT_Juliëtte.py. The data files are contained in the "files" folder. All other code can be ignored.  
Code may not be fully up to date with the version used for the final report due to small tweaks in plotting/data analysis and us being avoidant of merge errors related to jupyter changing their entire content of notebooks by simply opening one. However, the main functionality is fully present.
