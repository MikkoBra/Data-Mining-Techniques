# Data Mining Techniques 2025
Repository for the first assignment of Data Mining Techniques, made by group 23: Mikko Brandon, Marinde van Dijk, Juliëtte Dop.  
All relevant code can be found in DMT_Marinde_Mikko_2.ipynb and DMT_Juliëtte.py. The data files are contained in the "files" folder. All other code can be ignored.  
Because we were not aware that code had to be submitted, existing functions were sometimes modified to fit new tasks after completing old tasks, instead of making separate functions. As such, some plots and data found in the final report are not directly reproducible just by running the notebook. However, the core functionality required to reproduce the plots is present.
